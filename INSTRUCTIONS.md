# Prime Tier 1 Week 2 - Part 2

This week we introduced the programming language of the Internet, JavaScript. With JavaScript we can make our websites smart by adding interactivity and logic.

## Topics Covered
* Variables and Constants
* Conditional statements


## Assignment

As always, start off by forking and cloning this repository from GitHub. Open the code up in Atom to get started. 

> Note that in the future we will not call this out explicitly. We'll assume you already know that is how you start your work. 

### Files Provided

- [ ] *describe.js* (Required Features)

The describe.js file contains prompts for comments and code. It is for practicing explaining code without running it to see what happens. There is no HTML file provided to source in and trigger the JavaScript file to run. 

### Instructions 
Add comments as instructed into the `describe.js` file.

The file is broken into two sections: 
- The first section has you describe written code blocks in your own words. 
- In the second section, there is a description of how the code *should* work, but the code has an issue or "bug" in it for you to find. 

__Section 1__   
For questions 1-3, you will narrate what the code is doing. Remember the code here is correct. Just, describe in your own words what the code is doing.

Example:
```
// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}
```

__Section 2__   
For questions 4-6, you are given a description of how the code *should* behave. 
The code given will have something logically incorrect, and your job is to find the issue and make a comment describing what is wrong and how to fix it.

Example:
```
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number--; 
// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment. 
// Should be number++

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/
```
